Script to Improve Police Spawning
          *Police Enhancement*
          
This script aims to improve some cops related spawning issues, like if you use vehicles other than police2, police, pstockade, fbi, noose, polpatriot, nstockade in cargrp.dat, then blank empty cars would spawn and no cops inside.

 

You can use more cops/vehicles for making a better law for game.

 

There are many options to edit:

 

Weapons - Give whatever guns to cops. 

Models - There are 35 total slots for cops which are differentiated like [LCPD Cops, NOoSE, FiB, Army].

Vehicles Models - Here you can set which cop model to spawn with which law vehicle. Eg: [m_y_swat(NOoSE Units) can spawn with noose(Vapid NOoSE Cruiser).

Even you can set amount of peds you want inside the car(Max peds is 4 if it's a 4-Door Car, 2-Door if Sports car/Truck).


Now whenever you have wanted level 4 and above and you are piloting/Boating (Driving Helicopter/Boat) then helicopter will join the pursuit and try to Give you headshots.


When you reach 5 Stars of wanted level then an additional helicopter (total of 3 helicopter) will join the pursuit.

When 6 stars then total 4 helicopters and police will become aggressive and they will shoot you.


Everything is customisable.

And note:


In the game, every thing except peds/vehicles have been given some IDs you need to use them for assigning weapons to cops.

 

      Eg: 0 is used for Unarmed 

       1 is used for Baseball Bat
       .
       .
       .
       .
       .
       .
      57 is Used for AnyWeapon so 

      58 is used as AddOnWeapon_1 (which is a increased limit in ZolikaPatch)

      59 as AddOnWeapon_2 and so on.



**This is Beta and the Source available for V is not finished yet.
The Police Spawning is Disabled because of Coding Issues so use Released versions from GTAINSIDE or NEXUSMODS.**

If anyone willing to help me please let me know.

This script is a VisualBasic.NET script so it requires ScriptHookDotNet and ScriptHook and Game Patch 4,5,6,7,8
